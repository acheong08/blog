- [Mox](https://github.com/mjl-/mox/): The mail server I use. Very simple, written in Golang, easy to read/debug
- [Gozer](https://github.com/acheong08/gozer): Simple static site generator using Golang `html/templates`
- [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/): Firefox with good defaults. Patches out all the user-hostile decisions made by Mozilla
- [Invidious](https://iv.duti.dev/) ([source](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious)) - Lightweight frontend to YouTube. I host my own public instance - feel free to use it.
- [Hydroxide](https://github.com/emersion/hydroxide) ([my fork](https://github.com/acheong08/ferroxide)) - ProtonMail IMAP/SMTP bridge
- [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/) - An open source implementation of Tailscale's control server. All the services I self host run on Raspberry Pis and other machines at home & are reverse proxied through tailscale.
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) - Batteries included reverse proxy that handles TLS really well. Caddyfile is so much simpler than nginx configuration and the API allows for nice automation.
- [Reposilite](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/) - Self-hosted maven repository. The docker-compose version *just works*.
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) - Docker but better
- [Super Productivity](https://super-productivity.com/) - To do list and task tracking
- [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) - Distributed block storage for Kubernetes
- [Conduit](https://conduit.rs/) - Matrix Homeserver but Rust (Now that Dendrite has been abandoned...)
