Some amount of data collection is done to prevent DDOS and let me know when pages are getting jumps in traffic.

IP address is kept for 30 seconds by fail2ban and/or crowdsec for rate limiting.

Pages you visit on this site and the referrer header will be logged for 30 days. Anonymized statistics on browser and software are also aggregated to present an overview of percentages.

The data is self-hosted and will not be disclosed or sold unless compelled by law or force. I am legally bound by the laws of the UK and Malaysia, depending on time of year.
